# üìö Proxmox VE 9 Setup Guide

## Repository Configuration Explained

### Enterprise Repository
- **Requires paid Proxmox subscription**
- Provides stable, tested updates
- Includes commercial support
- Best for production environments

### No-Subscription Repository  
- **Free community repository**
- Same packages as enterprise repository
- No commercial support included
- Perfectly suitable for home/test use

### Test Repository
- Early access to new features
- May contain unstable packages
- Only for advanced users/testing environments
- **Should remain DISABLED unless specifically needed**

### Clean Reset Method
This script uses the **CLEAN RESET method** for repository configuration:
- Backs up all existing repositories
- Creates fresh deb822 format configuration
- Ensures compatibility with Proxmox VE 9
- Eliminates potential conflicts from mixed formats

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important After Repository Changes
**You MUST:**
1. Clear your browser cache (`Ctrl+Shift+R`)
2. Reboot the system for full effect

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Subscription Bypass Warning

### Legal and Ethical Notice

Installing a subscription bypass involves important considerations:

#### Legal Considerations
- May violate Proxmox VE license terms
- Could void any existing support agreements
- Use at your own risk and responsibility

#### Alternative Recommendations
- **Consider purchasing a Proxmox subscription**
- Supports the developers who create this software
- Provides access to enterprise repository
- Includes professional support

#### Community Support
- The no-subscription repository is **FREE**
- Provides the same software functionality
- Perfect for home labs and learning
- **No bypass needed for basic usage**

**Continue only if you understand these implications.**

## üîê SSH Key Security Implications

### What Adding SSH Keys Does
- Adds Bennell IT's public SSH key to root account
- Allows passwordless SSH access as root
- Provides remote administrative access

### Security Risks
- **Third-party access to your system**
- Potential unauthorized access
- Key owner has full system control

### Recommendations
- Only proceed if you trust Bennell IT completely
- Consider creating a separate user account instead
- Regularly audit `authorized_keys` file
- Monitor system logs for unexpected access

### Alternatives
- Set up your own SSH keys
- Use strong passwords with SSH
- Configure fail2ban for brute force protection

**Think carefully before proceeding!**

## üìä High Availability Services Guide

### What are HA Services?
- **pve-ha-lrm**: Local Resource Manager
- **pve-ha-crm**: Cluster Resource Manager  
- **corosync**: Cluster communication

### When to Enable HA Services
‚úÖ Multi-node Proxmox clusters  
‚úÖ Production environments  
‚úÖ Need VM/CT failover capability  
‚úÖ Planning to add nodes later  

### When to Disable HA Services
‚úÖ Single-node installations  
‚úÖ Home labs and testing  
‚úÖ Resource-constrained systems  
‚úÖ Maximum VM performance needed  

### Resource Savings (Single Node)
- ~50-100MB RAM reduction
- Lower CPU overhead
- Reduced network traffic
- Less disk I/O

**You can always re-enable later if needed!**

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Cluster Environment Warning

### Important for Clustered Environments

If you have **MULTIPLE Proxmox nodes** in a cluster:

#### Critical Requirements
- **Run this script on EVERY cluster node individually**
- Do NOT run on just one node
- Ensure consistent configuration across all nodes
- Repository changes must match on all nodes

#### Failure to Do This Can Cause
- Cluster instability
- Package version mismatches  
- Update failures
- Service disruptions

#### Recommended Procedure
1. Start with one node (maintenance mode)
2. Test changes thoroughly
3. Apply same changes to other nodes
4. Verify cluster health after each node

**This script does NOT automatically configure other cluster nodes!**

## üåê Browser Cache Warning

### Critical: Clear Browser Cache

After making changes to Proxmox, you **MUST** clear your browser cache!

#### Why This Matters
- Proxmox web UI caches JavaScript files
- Old cached files cause display issues
- Subscription nag may persist in cache
- Interface elements may not work correctly

#### How to Clear Cache

**Chrome/Firefox:**
- Press `Ctrl+Shift+R` (hard reload)
- Or `Ctrl+F5` (force refresh)
- Or manually clear browser cache

**Alternative:**
- Open private/incognito window
- Use different browser temporarily
- Clear all browsing data

#### Symptoms of Cache Issues
- Subscription nag still appears
- Interface looks broken/old
- JavaScript errors in console
- Features not working properly

**Don't skip this step!**
